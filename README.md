# Where We're Going, We Do Need Roads #

Inspired by the work of [@abagames][1], the man, the legend.

Sound design inherited from my last year's game, [Couch 2048][2]. Shoutouts to Marcus Geelnard, Jack Rugile, and Markus Neubrand!

Graphic design somewhat inspired by Blaster Master and Super Mario World.
